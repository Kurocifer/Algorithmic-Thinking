## Compound Words

## Problem

We are given a wordlist in which each word is a lowercase string. For exam-
ple, we might be given the wordlist containing crea, create, open, and te. We’ll
assume that the strings aren’t very long. Our task is to determine the strings
in the wordlist that are compound words: the concatenation of exactly two
other strings in the wordlist. For the given example, only the string create
is such a compound word, because it is the concatenation of crea and te.

## input

The input is one string (word) per line, in alphabetical order. We’ll get at
most 120,000 strings.

## output

The problem requires us to output each compound word on its own line, in
alphabetical order.
The time limit for solving the test cases is three seconds.
