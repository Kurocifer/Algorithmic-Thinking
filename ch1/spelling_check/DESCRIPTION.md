## Spelling Check: Deleting a Letter

Problem:

In this problem, we are given two strings where the first string has one more
character than the second. Our task is to determine the number of ways in
which one character can be deleted from the first string to arrive at the sec-
ond string. For example, there is one way to get from favour to favor: we can
remove the u from the first string. There are three ways to get from abcdxxxef
to abcdxxef: we can remove any of the x characters from the first string.
